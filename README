This project was forked from Google Code.

The Google Code version has no support for installation via PIP,
and is more difficult to contribute to.


This project currently provides:

  *  methods/wrappers for interacting with a Nessus server (launching scans,
       downloading reports, etc.)
  *  parsing of .nessus (v2) files, including some real handy helper
       functions/methods

Documentation is limited at the moment (sorry!) but these should be pretty self-explanatory. Some quick examples...

# Connecting to a server
n = pynessus.NessusServer(server, port, user, password)

# Launching a scan
n.launch_scan(scan_name, policy_id, target_list_iter)

# Download report
n.download_report(report_uuid)

.nessus usage is pretty easy as well. Some examples...

# Parsing a report
rpt = dotnessus_v2.Report()
rpt.parse(report_file_name.nessus)

# Iterating over targets, printing their names
for t in rpt.targets:
    print t.name

# Iterating over targets and their vulns
for t in rpt.targets:
    for v in t.vulns:
        print v.get('plugin_name'), v.get('solution')

# Finding a target and some vulns
t = rpt.get_target('some_server_name')
t.find_vuln(plugin_family='Windows', risk_factor='High')

Have fun!
